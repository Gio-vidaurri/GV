## About Me

I’m a **Senior Product Designer & Product Consultant** focused on building **scalable, data-driven digital products**.

My work goes beyond UI. I design and lead **complete product ecosystems**:  
information architecture, UX flows, design systems, CMS logic, analytics, SEO structure, and business rules—working closely with engineering, marketing, and stakeholders.

I specialize in **complex platforms** such as:
- E-commerce with advanced filtering & CRO
- SaaS & internal tools
- Content-heavy, SEO-driven websites
- Omnichannel & data-informed experiences

I care about one thing above all:  
**products that work, scale, and convert**.

## What I Actually Do

### Product & UX Strategy  
Translate business goals into structured product decisions: flows, modules, IA, priorities, and validation paths.

### UX / UI Design  
Design interfaces as part of a **system**, not isolated screens—focused on clarity, usability, accessibility, and scalability.

### Research & Validation  
Plan and execute usability testing, interviews, heuristics, and data analysis to reduce risk and guide iteration.

### Design Systems  
Create and maintain scalable design systems that align design and development, reduce friction, and accelerate delivery.

### E-commerce & CRO  
Optimize product listings, PDPs, filters, navigation, and content to improve discoverability, conversion, and performance.

### Technical SEO & Structure  
Design SEO from the ground up: URL structure, content hierarchy, internal linking, performance, and structured data.
